# React Projects

This is a repository for storing all of my React projects.
 
1. **Digital Business Card:**\
I completed this project as part of the ***Scrimba React 101 course***. I learned the basic structure of projects in React and how to create new components.
2. **Travel Journal:**\
It was the second project of the ***Scrimba React 101 course***. I learned how to utilize props and map data effectively.
3. **Interactive Travel Journal:**\
After completing the third part of the ***Scrimba React 101 course***, I decided to make my previous project interactive. I learned about state, conditional rendering, forms, and side effects in React. I implemented a feature that allows users to add new "Cards" by filling out a pop-up form. Additionally, users now have the ability to delete Cards. All data is connected to a **Firebase** database.
3. **Quizzical:**\
It was the last project of the ***Scrimba React 101 course***. The app fetches questions from the **Open Trivia Database API**. Users can select only one answer to each question. Upon submission, the app checks the answers and counts the points. Correct answers are highlighted in green, and incorrect answers are highlighted in red.
